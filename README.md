## A feed-forward neural network from scratch in C++ trained using the backpropagation algorithm

Unoptimized code that I wrote while I was learning advanced features (e.g. templates) of C++ in 2021. 

## Example
Just run the following commands in a linux terminal to start training a small network to learn how an XOR gate.  
```g++
g++ nn.cpp -o out.o // compile
./out.o // execute
```
